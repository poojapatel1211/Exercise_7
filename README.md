API parsing in P5.js

Using an open API, parse the json or XML data to pull out various bits of information. Then visualize this information on the screen in some way.

You can use the JSON file here called "rats.js." OR use another open API.
[OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/API) is another API that does not require API keys.

A few others are listed at the bottom of this [link:](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Loading-external-files:-AJAX,-XML,-JSON)

See Chapter 18 in LP AND reference Chapter 12 in Make: Getting Started with P5.js

Also, Daniel Shiffman has several videos up about parsing data in P5, including API's that require API keys. [Check it out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJaXOFfwGVw&index=1&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6a-SQiI4RtIwuOrLJGnel0r)
